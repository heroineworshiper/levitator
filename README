The levitator is just a PIC18F1320 connected to a BJT for driving the
electromagnet, a transistor of some kind for driving a cooling fan, & 2
hall effect sensors for sensing height.  It runs on 19V.  It uses a BJT
instead of a MOSFET for driving the magnet because BJTs were more
resistant to back EMF.

Hall effect sensors with the lowest mV/G or lowest sensitivity are best.

MAGNET_DELAY0 has to be adjusted depending on the weight of the model
TARGET_ADC determines the height
